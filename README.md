# Hidden Markov Models and Dynamic linear models applied to space-time data
In this group project the aim was to provide a forecast for the pollution levels of different locations in California between June and September 2020.
Both a hidden Markov model and a Dynamic linear model were fit. Here, the spatial observations are set to have a exponential covariance function 
decreasing in the distance so that the closer the observations are, the more the predictions will be correlated.
